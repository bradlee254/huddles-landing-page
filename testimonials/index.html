                transition and have heard some people who had amaizing experience here. 
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredebly fun! 
                i enrolled shortly thereafter. The next twelve weeks was the best - and most grueling

                Awesome teaching and support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
                Getting guidaince from them and learning from their experience was easy.

                the program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and 
                present myself as a capable developer. The standard is above the rest. You will

                "Before joining bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. i needed  some 
                structures for proffessionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                I was encouraged to enrol by a former student of theirs who can say wonderful 
                things about the program. The entire curriculumn and staff did not disappoint. they
                were hands-om and never had to wait long for assistance. the agile team project, 
                in particular, was outstanding. I took my learning to the next level in a way that 
                no tutorial could ever had . In fact , I've often reffered to it during interviews as an 
                example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as full-stack 
                developer after reciving multiple offers. 100% recommended."
